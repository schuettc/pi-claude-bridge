/**
 * agent_start records the fully-widened system prompt.
 *
 * MCP tool descriptions merge into the system prompt only after their servers
 * connect — after before_agent_start. So event.systemPrompt there is the pre-widen
 * prompt, while the prompt the provider actually queries with (and that pi-subagents
 * embeds verbatim into a child via ctx.getSystemPrompt() at dispatch) is the widened
 * one. If only the pre-widen prompt is a capture key, a subagent's turn resolves
 * against nothing, falls to a verbatim side request, and ships pi's harness — which
 * trips the server's third-party plan-eligibility check ("out of extra usage").
 *
 * These pin that agent_start records ctx.getSystemPrompt(), so the widened prompt
 * resolves directly and a child embedding it resolves by inheritance.
